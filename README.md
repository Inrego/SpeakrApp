[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Inrego/SpeakrApp?sort=semver)](https://github.com/Inrego/SpeakrApp/releases/latest)

A Flutter client for [Speakr](https://github.com/learnedmachine/speakr), the self-hosted audio transcription and meeting-notes server. Runs on **Android**, **iOS**, and **Windows desktop**.

Record meetings live, upload existing audio, watch transcription progress, then read AI-generated summaries with speaker-attributed transcripts — all against your own Speakr instance.

## Features

- **Live recording** with a tag picker, pause/resume, and a Windows always-on-top mini recorder that survives switching apps.
- **Upload existing audio** (m4a, mp3, wav, …) with optional min/max speakers, language, tags, meeting date, and notes.
- **Auto-upload** watcher (Android + Windows): drop files into a folder and they upload in the background via `workmanager`.
- **Auto-record** (Windows): start recording automatically when system audio or the mic crosses a threshold — implemented in pure-Dart FFI, no native build glue.
- **Library** with live status badges (`PENDING → PROCESSING → SUMMARIZING → COMPLETED`).
- **Detail view** with three tabs: Markdown summary, speaker-attributed transcript, and metadata.
- **Speaker review**: rename speakers with autocomplete from your global speaker list and per-segment suggestion chips.
- **Auth** via `X-API-Token` stored in OS secure storage (Keychain / Keystore / Windows Credential Manager).

## Download / Releases

Prebuilt artifacts for tagged versions are published on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Inrego/SpeakrApp/releases) page.

### Android

- **Direct download:** grab the universal `.apk` from the latest [release](https://github.com/Inrego/SpeakrApp/releases/latest) and install it (enable "install from unknown sources" if your device prompts you).
- **Google Play:** the signed app bundle (`.aab`) is built for the Play track; once published it can be installed from the Play Store listing.

### Windows

The desktop app ships in two forms on each release:

- **Installer** — `Speakr-Setup-<version>.exe` (Inno Setup). Recommended for most users; adds Start Menu entries and handles upgrades.
- **Portable zip** — `Speakr-<version>-windows-x64.zip`. Unzip anywhere and run `speakr_app.exe`; no install required.

> **Note:** the Windows builds are **unsigned**. Windows SmartScreen may show a "Windows protected your PC" warning the first time you run the installer or executable. Choose **More info → Run anyway** to proceed. This is expected for an unsigned community build.

## Android permissions

If you sideload the APK, Android will ask for a few permissions that deserve an
explanation:

- **Access to folders you pick** — only used by **auto-upload**. You point
  Speakr at folders written by your call recorder or voice recorder using
  Android's own folder picker (the Storage Access Framework); Speakr keeps that
  per-folder grant, uploads new recordings to your own Speakr server and then
  **deletes the local copy** so the phone does not fill up. The grant covers
  only the folders you picked, so Speakr cannot browse or upload anything else.
  Leave auto-upload off and you never grant it.
  *Earlier builds requested **All files access** (`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`) for
  this instead. That permission is being removed — the migration to the folder
  picker lands in a separate PR — and a SAF folder grant deletes other apps'
  files in that folder without any per-file prompt, so All files access was never
  actually needed.*
- **Phone state** (`READ_PHONE_STATE`) — used purely as a timing signal: when a
  call ends, Speakr schedules one scan of your watched folders so a fresh call
  recording gets picked up. No call log, no phone number, no caller identity — the
  call-log permissions are not declared at all.
- **Microphone** and **screen capture** — the in-app recorder. Screen capture is
  how Android exposes system audio, so a recording that includes the other side of
  a call asks for the system capture consent dialog each session. Only audio is
  captured; nothing about the screen is read or stored.
- **Notifications** — the persistent notification shown while recording or
  uploading.

Everything recorded or uploaded goes to the server URL you entered and nowhere
else. The app also allows plain `http://` traffic, because self-hosted Speakr
servers commonly run on a LAN address without TLS.

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK **^3.11.0** (Dart 3.11+)
- A reachable Speakr server (REST API v1) and an API token from its **Account → API Tokens** page
- Platform toolchains for whichever targets you build:
  - Android: Android Studio + Android SDK 24+
  - iOS: Xcode on macOS (untested in CI — see _Known limitations_)
  - Windows: Visual Studio 2022 with the "Desktop development with C++" workload

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Inrego/SpeakrApp.git
cd SpeakrApp

flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run on the platform of your choice
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d <android-device-id>
flutter run -d <ios-device-id>
```

On first launch the app shows an **Onboarding** screen. Enter:

1. Your Speakr server URL (e.g. `https://speakr.example.com`)
2. An API token

Both are stored via `flutter_secure_storage` and never logged. The app talks only to the server you configure — there is no hard-coded backend.

## Building releases

### Tag-based CI (recommended)

Releases are driven by Git tags. Pushing a tag of the form `vX.Y.Z` triggers the release workflow, which builds the Android AAB + universal APK and the Windows installer + portable zip, then publishes them to a GitHub Release:

```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

The version name (`X.Y.Z`) comes from the tag (without the leading `v`) and the build number comes from the GitHub Actions run number. A `workflow_dispatch` run can also build artifacts on demand (using the `version:` from `pubspec.yaml`) without publishing a Release.

### Local builds

```bash
# Windows
flutter build windows --release

# Android (arm64)
flutter build apk --release --target-platform android-arm64

# iOS (requires macOS + signing)
flutter build ipa --release
```

The Windows app icon is generated from [`speakr-mark-square.svg`](speakr-mark-square.svg) by `tools/build_icon_sources.dart`, which embeds 16/24/32/48/64/128/256 sub-images rendered fresh from the SVG (rather than downscaling a single PNG). Re-run it if the mark changes.

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the rationale behind each choice and the pitfalls we have already paid for.

## Development

```bash
flutter analyze            # must be clean before merge
flutter test
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs   # after editing freezed models
```

The OpenAPI spec at [`openapi/speakr-openapi.json`](openapi/speakr-openapi.json) is the source of truth for endpoints. The Dart client is hand-rolled — when you add an endpoint, mirror the `_get` / `_post` / `_unwrap` helpers in [`lib/api/speakr_api.dart`](lib/api/speakr_api.dart).

## Known limitations

- **iOS** builds compile but have not been verified end-to-end (no Mac in CI).
- **Linux** is not a supported target — there is no `linux/` platform directory. (`record_linux` appears only as a transitive dependency of `record` in `pubspec.lock`; it is not a Linux build target.)
- No offline cache, no resumable uploads, no push notifications when transcription finishes — the Library re-polls on refresh.

## Contributing

Please read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before opening a PR. It documents the dependency pins, the lints we have intentionally disabled, and a few traps that are easy to fall into (notably: do **not** add `riverpod_generator` — the analyzer plugin it pulls in breaks `build_runner` on Dart 3.11).
